# 🎓 AI-Powered Career Chatbot

An intelligent Streamlit-based chatbot that provides career guidance based on your questions. It uses a trained machine learning model to classify your intent and return the most relevant career advice from a curated dataset.

## 🌟 Features

- 🤖 AI-powered career recommendation engine
- 📚 Suggests best-matching career roles
- ❓ Matches your input to the most relevant question
- 🧠 Displays detailed answers from real-world career Q&A
- 🧾 Chat history with timestamps

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Your input question is vectorized using a **TF-IDF** vectorizer.
2. A **Logistic Regression** model predicts your career intent (role).
3. The chatbot finds the most relevant Q&A for that role using **cosine similarity**.
4. A matching answer is returned with helpful context.
